        <p class="summary">
        With the cyber skills gap growing within the UK the government produced cyber discovery as a way to approach this gap within the younger generation. The programme has multiple stages and involves students completing challenges to find flags. The whole site is based on a fictional character called Agent J and presents topics of ranging levels in a fun format. This audio clip discusses the programme as a whole and whether it is appropriate for students as young as 13 to be taught these skills and whether a game format is really appropriate.

          <h3>COMMENTS</h3>
          <p class="comment">
            <strong><u>Amy S:</u></strong> The study mentioned in the “Play it safe” article showed that children aged 7-10 actively learnt more about cyber through game-based learning than a text based approach. This has also been shown in other studies based on high school students showing that this is an effective learning method.
          </p>
          <p class="comment">
            <strong><u>Adam S:</u></strong> Treating it as a game and a text approach are not the only methods of teaching. Surely, we can find a way that teaches better than just text without trivialising the issue to make it seem like a game. Children should be aware how important it is and how misuse can have a bad effect on people’s lives.
          </p>
          <p class="comment">
            <strong><u>Amy S:</u></strong> Should role play acting as a hacking be encouraged in younger children? It seems to me that this gamified approach prevents hacking from being viewed seriously as a crime.
          </p>
          <p class="comment">
            <strong><u>Adam S:</u></strong> Hacking is not a game and should not be treated like one. In a digital world people whole lives are online so for example compromising a banking system isn't a game, it contains people’s life savings and should be respected. Playing god with life savings or computer system which may contain a person’s entire photo collection of their life, is not right and especially should not be supported for children.

            <strong><u>Amy S:</u></strong> This programme seems to of had a great effect on educating students about cyber security and has helped lots of them get a boost into the industry. The more these students are educated about hacking techniques the better they can be at protecting themselves. I feel that the game-based approach just makes for a more fun experience and does not go against the fact that the techniques they learn need to be used with consent. Overall, I think this programme is really helping to reduce the skills gap by educating children from a younger age.

          <p class="comment">
            <strong><u>Adam S:</u></strong> This sort of learning material has a lot of scope for misuse so should be controlled. While training the future is important it should be done in a heavily controlled environment, not remotely. Students should be closely monitored and all tasks in an environment that is sandboxed so they cannot use the tools outside the course.

            This is a primary source so should give exact figures and information about the programme as well as display how they are encouraging the youth into it. On the other hand, as they are the people that run it they might of tinted the data to make their programme seem better for example they might of included numbers of people that signed up but never took part. In general, it gives a good insight into how they are promoting cyber security and hacking and it’s kept up to date and is easy to navigate.

            This is a primary source about a piece of research that has been carried out by the university of Texas on game based learning in the context of teaching cyber safety. The source is very recent and is backed up by other studies making it a more reliable resource. The study is only based of 49 7-10 year olds which is a very small sample size suggesting that the data could have been easily skewed to display as particular result.

            This article is very short and only gives his opinion on the topic however it is particularly useful in understanding different viewpoints of cyber space. Although it is quite old the same ideas presented by him are still prevalent in today’s cyber world.

Although this article is a few years out of date it relates to use of avatars and cheating in games which is still common with online games children play today. The study referred to however was undertaken in 2012 meaning that children’s views on hacking on online games could have changed dramatically. The study is also based upon children in Norway so it is unclear whether these same issues and viewpoints are prevalent within children in the UK. On the other hand, the study includes a large sample, documenting over 400 online worlds suggesting that the conclusions drawn are more reliable as it is less easily biased.
