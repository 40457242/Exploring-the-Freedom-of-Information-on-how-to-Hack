          Today's world is growing increasingly cyber - the internet is everywhere. There is now a high demand for security to be implemented across the world to secure the 9.9 billion internet connected devices (which is predicted to grow to 21.5 billion devices by 2025). The best way to solve a problem is through the sharing of knowledge, through learning and education. The main source of information today is this huge thing available to anyone who can get even a mediocre connection... the internet.

          There is alot of information out there on the web about how to hack, and people devote their whole lives to cyber security and hacking (whether ethical hacking or not). Many, may start from a young age, and this vast amount of freely available information makes it very easy for anyone (the youth included) to learn about hacking and cyber security. This of course comes with downsides... whose to say that everyone who learns these skills will use them for good? To quote Uncle Ben from Spiderman... with great power, comes great responsibility.
