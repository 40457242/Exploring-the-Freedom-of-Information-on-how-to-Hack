          <h3>COMMENTS</h3>
          <p class="comment">
            <strong><u>Adam S:</u></strong> Just because cyber crimes would occur anyway doesnt mean that we shouldn't attempt to reduce them, making this information harder to access may mean less people are encouraged to try to compromise systems or data

          <p class="comment">
            <strong><u>Amy S:</u></strong> With the increasing presence children have online from a young age in some circumstances they are unaware of the legalities behind what they are doing. In these circumstances can it really be considered their fault or have society failed them?
          </p>
          <p class="comment">
            <strong><u>Adam S:</u></strong> Ignorance of the law is not a defence. Its pretty clear accessing things you aren't meant to is wrong. If you are learning something you should be aware of the legalities of it, that's on you.
          </p>
          <p class="comment">
            <strong><u>Amy S:</u></strong> E.H. Fiallo mentions "The Cyber World has become a most important part of our everyday lives...There is dark side to this phenomenon. The ease and anonymity by which we are able to perform all and many more of these feats of contact and access with an entire universe of places and people has created a dilemma: a lack of Cyber Ethics. This issue threatens all of us and introduces a whole set of ethical and legal issues for business people, scientists, parents, educators, children and law makers.". Is it too easy now for the youth of today to hide online? Maybe children just see hacking as an exciting activity that allows them to prove their skills or gain access to things that they have been denied. Everyone remembers their parents trying to restrict online activities, by restricting children online though is this just increasing their curiosity and desire to bypass things? and could this buzz encourage more events that aren't as harmless?
          </p>
          <p class="comment">
            <strong><u>Adam S:</u></strong> Information on its own is harmless and we should try to stop people learning. Instead we should focus on teaching them how to use it for good reasons. Ethical hacking taught and unethical practices discouraged

          <h3>ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY</h3>
          <p>Wilson, C., 2006.15-Year-Old Admits Hacking NASA Computers. [online] ABC News. Available at: https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=119423&page=1 [Accessed 7 May 2020].This is the news article describing an event mentioned in the audio clip. This page appears to be an accurate reflection of events coming from a reputable news site, it also quotes the US Justice Department so can be considered accurate as the report draws directly from the government body who’s actions it was reporting it. This makes it more likely the content of the report is accurate. On the other hand as a news website it has its own natural bias and agenda which may affect on its reporting however this article appears to offer no commentary on what it is reporting and instead seems to provide a detached view of the facts</p>
          <p>Bennetto, J., 1997.Fine For Boy Who Hacked Into Pentagon. [online] The Independent. Available at: https://www.independent.co.uk/news/fine-for-boy-who-hacked-into-pentagon-1274204.html [Accessed 7 May 2020]This is another news article dated from 1997. It can be considered a decent article as it draws from the testimony of those involved and the statement of the magistrates. However this article appears to be less useful as it seems to heavy politicise and sensationalise the issue. The article seems to first offer up straight facts on the case before publishing statements from the US Senate that this boy was a serious threat to national security and seemingly giving voice to sensationalised words about the possible dangers instead of just reporting the facts. This and the poor reputation of the site suggest this article may need to be seen with healthy scepticism.</p>
          <p>Her Majesty’s Government.2018. Cyber Security Breaches Survey 2018. [online]  https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/cyber-security-breaches-survey-2018 [Accessed 12/06/20]This source is produced and published by HMG as a result of theirstatistics for the year for this reason it be be considered accurate. They are not a news site with a political agenda, they are a government body releasing the facts so there is less danger of misrepresentation of information to fit an agenda. It could be considered that the agency may be trying to under-report crime figures to make themselves look more competent however this does not appear to be the case as some of the statistics contained within (particularly conviction rates) are very poor suggesting what is reported is accurate</p>
          <p>Mark Bridge. 2018. Hackers go free from prosecution. [online]. The Times. https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/hackers-go-free-from-prosecution-drtld6ncp [Accessed 12/06/20]The times is a well known and well respected news site, whose reputation would suggest that te information they publish would be well researched and accurate. However they quote research down by an outside firm, making this secondary data. This could mean that data has been misinterpreted or that during the data’s collection the method may have not been perfect, because of this it can be considered t be a less useful source.</p>
