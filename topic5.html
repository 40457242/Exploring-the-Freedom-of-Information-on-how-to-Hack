          Online web courses have grown exponentially in popularity over the past years, this is down to a wider awareness in society, news of cyber related crime and a greater push for education in school to teach children from a young age about keeping safe online and maintaining a secure online presence.<br><br>
          Websites such as Udemy has thrived in this environment as people flock to their site by the thousands every day to learn and develop new skills. Cyber security related courses have exploded in popularity as more people want to learn the skills regarding how to exploit and hack; whether this is for personal and ethical reasons for gaining a wider knowledge or it has malicious intent to learn to exploit cyber vulnerabilities is up for debate.

            <strong><u>Mitchell K:</u></strong> I agree with you - there are so many courses available (FOR FREE) and Udemy is known for offering HUGE discounts on their paid courses - what is listed as normally £200, gets reduced to £20, or even £9.99, making the courses available to people with less money... if you ask me, little money would be a good motive to get into hacking and cyber crime - a LOT of money can be made there... is it really such a good thing that the courses are so cheap and available to anyone? Furthermore, those courses have so many students... how many of those use their newly aquired skills for bad?!

            <strong><u>Tom Be:</u></strong> Regardless of the fact that these skills can be used for malicious purposes, there are many high end and high paying jobs who require people proficient in cyber security. Hence by having free or cheap access to these types of educational courses, it allows people to further their knowledge and understanding of the topic, which leads to employment opportunities. This information would always be available to learn elsewhere under the freedom of information and free speech, so these skills are always out there and available.
