        <p class="summary">
          With online cyber learning platforms on the rise such as Try Hack Me, Hack The Box, Cyber Sec Labs, Pwn College and Servmor Security, hacking is becoming incredibly straightforward for anyone to learn. Of course, technical skills and understanding are required, and hackers often have an analytical mindset prepared for problem solving, however the information is freely Available within these platofrms, as well as the platforms themselves providing a place to actually practice hacking!
          The main issue with these platforms, is that they perfectly appeal to the youth - gamifying the practice of hacking with leaderboards, challenges, and points for completing 'rooms' of vulnerable boxes. Studies show that learning from games is the most efficient way to learn, as this is how children learn everything so quickly from a very young age (University, S. (2013). Using games as an educational tool provides opportunities for deeper learning [online] Stanford News). Coupled with the fact that many 'Youtubers' post videos completing the rooms on Hack The Box, Try Hack Me, or other 'capture the flag' competition platforms, means that the youth are increasingly likely to stumble across them and begin learning a potentially dangerous skill which is protrayed as something fun and cool.

          A study written by Qing Hu, Chenghong Zhang, and Zhengchuan Xu into why there is a 'youth computer hacking epidemic', decides that the most likely of youths to become interested in hacking were those who played more video games than sports, and the youth are often stereotyped for their passion of gaming. Since these platforms gamify hacking, it can be seen why the youth are drawn to hacking as a hobby, but whose to say it won't go on further in the future to become something more malicious. The study states that many of todays computer hacking activities were in fact from "computer savvy" college and high school students. According to research undertaken, 34% of student across 3 universities in the United States admitted to commiting some form of software misuse. There is no conclusive evidence stating that these platforms are responsible, however it is entirely possible that they could be (due to the openness of them, and how simple they make the learning process of hacking).

            <strong><u>Tom Be:</u></strong> General knowledge is valued information regarding social interests, community and culture. Using this, you can argue the viewpoint that the openness of websites such as TryHackMe and HackTheBox increases awareness for the cyber security industry allowing people to be more secure with their data and grow their personal security to a higher understanding. This type of general knowledge would be passed through word of mouth amongst the community which overall has a positive impact on the social understandings of cyber security and the threats it can pose.

            <strong><u>Mitchell K:</u></strong> All of this information is free to absolutely anyone - you don't know their motives. Literally anyone, good or bad, can sign up and start learning from all of the free content. Then, for £8 per month they can get access to everything else too - the learning paths which teach from literally nothing! For so cheap this is perfect/ideal for the youth - £8 is pocket money! I can imagine it would be incredibly fast for someone with the correct motivation to learn enough to become experienced enough to use their skills maliciously - especially with all of the other content online! This is a bad thing for society and almost certainly could lead to a future threat!

            <strong><u>Tom Be:</u></strong> As a facilitator for educational media, they focus on providing knowledge, awareness and training to all, they cannot discriminate based on peoples initial motive to start learning. Instead they can offer educational guidance and factual information regarding ethics and law to influence people to only use this knowledge for good.

            This source is a secondary source of information, as they reference data collected in previous studies. It is also 8 years old, however the studies made are clearly relevant, as it references statistics discovered back then. If anything, the greater frequency in existence of cyber tuition/game sites could lead to this figure being larger.
