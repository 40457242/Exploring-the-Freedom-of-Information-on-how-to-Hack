          The podcast below is a discussion about the openness of google with regards to the ease of access to hacking materials. The focus of this podcast is on the easiness to search for materials and then moves onto Reddit, a forum style social media platform, which has many self-registered communities for users to join. I explore in more depth the specific side of Reddit which is used by hackers in order to learn new skills and discover new techniques for ‘ethical’ purposes.

            <strong><u>Millie W:</u></strong> If you believe that some people will be using this information to hack for bad reasons, what would your proposal be to stop this? Many people call for the banning of publishing of information like this, but this presents a problem: people will always conduct activities like hacking, so they would continue to teach this to others, perhaps on the dark web? Isn't it better for this information to be kept on the open web, where it can be monitored and screened, rather than forcing those interested in hacking to look on the dark web, and perhaps get involved in criminal activity?

            <strong><u>Freddie P:</u></strong> Although the problem raised here involves censorship to all content, I propose that only the more detailed content explaining how to guides is limited, not entirely removed, and to gain access to this there must be some verification process. For example, even just a basic age verification process could suffice as it means that children would actively have to look for this content and this may prevent curious minds from exploring such sites, with regards to your point on the dark web, the access may be made more difficult if it isn’t as easy to find the systems required to access it.
