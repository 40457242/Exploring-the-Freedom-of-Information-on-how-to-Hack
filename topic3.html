        <p class="summary">The ethical arguments surrounding hacking information being freely available are complex. It is just as easy to say that people are hacking for good as it is to say they are hacking for bad. Not only this- it often crosses over to the issues of censorship which are just as divisive. In 2019, YouTube published their terms of service containing their ban on hacking content, which sparked wide debate in the online technology community.</p>

            <strong><u>Freddie P:</u></strong> The problem with YouTube is there are a lot of children who idolize youtubers but as we all know it is all too easy to click the play next video and spiral into a completely different topic, this may mean children who don’t already have an interest in computers may use these videos to easily learn to hack without the ethical disclaimer stating that these skills must only be used with permission of the user
          </p>
          <p class="comment">
            <strong><u>Millie W:</u></strong> Perhaps a more appropriate response for YouTube would be to update their terms of use, rather than banning all hacking content, allow it to be shown in a place they can monitor, and require that all people publishing content related to hacking show an ethical disclaimer at the start of their videos, and clearly explain their intentions. Much like the "don’t try this at home, kids" line from television, "don’t hack things at home" may also apply here.
          </p>
          <p class="comment">
            <strong><u>Freddie P:</u></strong> I can agree with that, however, perhaps it may be worth putting a message that requires clicking on saying that this content is not suitable for children and requires them to sign in. They should also hide it from the suggestion bar on the right of the video when the user isn’t watching related content and should never autoplay on it.
